subject: potential danger
This antimass-spectrometer worries me. While mostly unlikely, I can't overlook the possibility of a resonance cascade
if we are ever to use any extreme samples. I greatly suggest we start with small things, as a resonance cascade could
genuinely spell the end for not just our laboratory, but the human race.
