Hey Rob, I just talked to Terrence about the antimass-spectrometer, and its potential dangers.
He claims that its designed for optimal safety, but after looking at the blueprints and patents,
it doesn't meet any of our lab safety standards, or many safety standards at all for that matter.
I have a really bad feeling about all this.
